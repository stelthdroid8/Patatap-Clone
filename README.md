# Patatap-Clone
## Utilizes Howler.js as well as Paper.js to create a clone similiar to patatap.com

In this program I sought to create a similiar clone of patatap.com which shows an animation randomly on your screen as well as play a designated sound depending on the key you press. This is a simpler version as it only currently draws circles for each key 'a-z'. It only works with the 'a-z' letters currently.
